# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

Here are some important things to check when you contribute:

  * Update the appropriate chapter.
  * Add the new paper to the markdown file
  * If your contribution has an implementation please add the link to the implementation.
  * Do not forget to update the AUTHORS.MD.
